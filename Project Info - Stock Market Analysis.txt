This project is the analysis of stock market data using Python.

This uses pandas to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. 
Also, we will predict future stock prices through a Monte Carlo method.

Some questions to answer through analysis:

1. What was the change in price of the stock over time?
2. What was the daily return of the stock on average?
3. What was the moving average of the various stocks?
4. What was the correlation between different stocks' closing prices?
4. What was the correlation between different stocks' daily returns?
5. How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
6. How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?
